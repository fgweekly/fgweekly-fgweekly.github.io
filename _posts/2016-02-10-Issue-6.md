## Guilty Gear Xrd Revelator Europe Release is Same Week as NA

Is it real life? If you're from Europe and like Arc System Works games, you are an unlucky fella. Arc games in Europe are at best always late to the party, at worse a mess you don’t want to deal with. So when PQube announced that REVELATOR, the next iteration of Guilty Gear Xrd, will be out the same day as the NA version, we wondered if it was a joke. But it looks like it’s true.

## Mad Catz laying off 37 percent of staff in restructuring after Rock Band 4 disappoints

Sad news for the American company that brought us the T.E arcade stick as its last investment, Rock Band 4, wasn't enough to keep the company in good shape. 37 percent of its staff has to be let go, and the company is restructuring to be able to maintain its business. Our hearts goes out to those who lost their jobs, as we wish Mad Catz to regain its strength.
