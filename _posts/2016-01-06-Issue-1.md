## Activision Blizzard acquires the business of Major League Gaming

The MLG, worldwide known tournament organizers and streamers, has officially been bought by Activision Blizzard. The organization, which has dabbled quite a lot with fighting games over the years (most recently Super Smash Bros for Wii U and Mortal Kombat X), is now part of an effort to create *"the ESPN of eSports"* under its new supervision. Hopefully, that'll still include fighting games and not become a giant ad for Activision Blizzard games.
