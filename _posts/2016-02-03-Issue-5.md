## Pocket Fighters early access is now on Steam

After a successful crowdfunding a few months ago, Pocket Fighter just landed on Steam as an early access game. Inspired by the NeoGeo Pocket fighting games, it features two characters at the moment (6 more to come plus multiple bosses), two buttons controls and a simplified health system. If you're interested in helping to beta-test the game, it will cost you 9.99$ to join. A steal!

## Most PS4 arcade sticks won't work with Street Fighter V on PC

You thought Capcom was getting better at handling their PC version? Guess again, as we learned, thanks to Mark "The Man" Julio from MadCatz, that Street Fighter V on PC won't support D-input. Which means most PS4 arcade sticks that don’t include a switch from D-Input to X-Input, since the PS4 is D-Input by default.
