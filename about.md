#Our philosophy
    
The past 8 years saw the rise of fighting games and an increasing amount of news about games, tournaments and players.
This content, by its diversity and quality, is a wonderful testimony of the knowledge, passion and dedication from the fighting game community content creators.
But this massive amount of information is now overwhelming and we feel it's time for a more slow-paced, curated news outlet.

This is Fighting Games Weekly.

#Who we are

FG Weekly is curated by Thomas [*'Thomasorus'*](https://twitter.com/brownleatherguy) Loreille and Maxime [*'Otaxou'*](https://twitter.com/otaxou) Lancelin-Golbery. 

Logo and visuals created by Guillaume [*'MVCDLM'*](https://twitter.com/mvcdlm) Brindon.
